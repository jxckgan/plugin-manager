# plugin-manager

`plugin-manager` is an application that scans (AU, AAX, VST2/3) audio plugins and groups them via their vendors. It allows you to bulk delete (via moving to the trash) or manually select plugins by said vendor.

> Temporary bug: All items will be grouped properly (though always double check what you're selecting) but sometimes the name won't be exact (e.g. Roland becomes "co")

### To-do

- [ ] Add CLAP support
- [ ] Add ability to move plugins
- [ ] Fix that bug

> Made because Plugin Alliance doesn't have a bloody uninstaller...
